# 💈 imperiuM | Barbershop Website
🇺🇸 Welcome to imperiuM!

- Project created with full focus on Django, Semantic UI, JS, and Git best practices.
- Fictitious application, but based on a real project carried out as a freelance job.
- The main technical goal was to successfully apply Django’s structure and properly separate directories to improve code organization and facilitate future maintenance
### Clean, minimalist, and modern design, focused on making it simple for the client to navigate and find their way around the site. Although the primary focus was backend development, it was possible to work with concepts using only Semantic UI and make good use of it.
